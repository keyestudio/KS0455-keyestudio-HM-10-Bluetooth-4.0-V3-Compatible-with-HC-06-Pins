## 1. Description

Bluetooth technology is a wireless standard technology that enables short-distance data exchange between fixed devices, mobile devices, and building personal area networks (using UHF radio waves in the ISM band of 2.4 to 2.485 GHz).

The Keyestudio HM-10 Bluetooth-4.0 V3 module is a master-slave machine. When use as the Host, it can send commands to the slave actively; when use as the Slave, it can only receive commands from the host.

The HM-10 Bluetooth module supports the Bluetooth 4.0 protocol, which not only supports Android mobile, but also supports iOS system.

## 3. Pins Description

| Pins  | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BRK   | Input pin; short press for control, or input a low-level single pulse of about 1000ms, you can implement the following features:<br>(1) In sleep state: <br>The module will be woken up to normal status. If AT+NOTI is turned on, the serial port will receive<br>OK+WAKE<br>(2) In connected state: <br>The module will initiate a disconnect request<br>(3) In standby state: <br>The module will return to the factory default state. |
| RXD   | Serial data input                                            |
| TXD   | Serial data output                                           |
| GND   | ground                                                       |
| VCC   | Power positive input 5V                                      |
| STATE | Output pin<br>Indicates the working states:<br>Slow flash in standby mode - repeat 500ms pulse;<br>Long bright in connection state - high level.<br>You can also set it to no flashing in the standby state, and long bright in the connection state. |

## 5. Test Code

Download Resource :  [Resource](./Resource.7z)

Note： before uploading the code, you need to import the library files; otherwise, the code upload will fail.

When uploading the code, CANNOT connect the Bluetooth module; otherwise uploading fails!
You are supposed to upload the code to control board, then connect the Bluetooth module.

```c
#include "DFRobot_ST7687S_Latch.h"

#ifdef __AVR__
uint8_t pin_cs = 3, pin_rs = 5, pin_wr = 6, pin_lck = 7;
#else
uint8_t pin_cs = D3, pin_rs = D5, pin_wr = D6, pin_lck = D7;
#endif

DFRobot_ST7687S_Latch tft(pin_cs, pin_rs, pin_wr, pin_lck);

void setup(void)
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  tft.begin();
  tft.fillScreen(DISPLAY_WHITE);
}

void loop(void)
{
  tft.drawTriangle(-20, -50, 0, 0, 50, 20, DISPLAY_ORANGE);  //draw triangle
  delay(1000);
  tft.fillScreen(DISPLAY_WHITE);
}
```

## 6. Result

First should install the APP on the cellphone.

**Android APP**

Allow APP to access “location” in settings of your cellphone when connecting to Bluetooth module.

We only provide Android APP.

APP installed well, you can see the icon![](media/image-20260120143958288.png)on your Android phone.

After wiring, upload the test code to UNO R3 board and then connect the Bluetooth module. Powered on, Bluetooth module’s built in LED flashes.

Open the Android APP![](media/image-20260120144028026.png),click to scan device. As shown below.
